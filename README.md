# **Sensor Haptic Guitar with Quantum Probabilistic Data Analysis**

## Background & Intuitive Ideas
</br>

### Robotics and Algorithms
(Can I use the input from the client to give recommendations of possible songs that might sound good?)
<br>
- Client input through an interactive virtual instrument (guitar) connected to midi
- Data recording of sensor input
- Analysis and comparison of possible following notes and chords based on regular computer algorithms of music theory

### Data Analysis and Quantum
(What does Quantum sound like when compared to our idea of music? If not music then how does it sound in general when compared to regular algorithms?)
</br>
- Connection of quantum and sound
- Usage of probabilistic states of a particle in Qiskit to analyze guitar input
- Analysis to look for any sort of connection (think vibrational waves of sound vs quantum)

### Visualization and Human Expression
(Can we showcase in an easy way for people to digest? Humanize the idea of quantum slightly or find a way this project might help people understand?)
</br>
- Interactive
- Relatively cheap
- use visualizations to compare (While playing)
